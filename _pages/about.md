I'm a third year ECE PhD candidate in UIUC [SiNRG](https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/) advised by Professor [Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/). In general my area is signal processing and data science. My interest is to find the best world between classical signal processing and the current state of deep learning. I believe signal models would create a more **explanable** and **efficient** foundation for today's machine learning models.

On the application side, I mostly worked on microphone array speech processing and audio-visual speech processing (enhancement, dereverberatin, separation, compressive coding). I'm very much into the concept of mixed reality. One example is our [Earable Computing](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/earables.html) aiming for acoustics augmented reality. 

I also work with Professor [Mark Hasegawa-Johnson](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~hasegawa/) if any project is related to speech processing.
