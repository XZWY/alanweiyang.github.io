I'm a third year ECE PhD candidate in UIUC [SiNRG](https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/) advised by Professor [Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/). In general my area is signal processing and data science. My interest is to find the best world between classic signal processing and the current state of deep learning. I believe signal models would create a more **explanable** and **efficient** foundation for today's machine learning models.

On the application side, I mostly worked on microphone array speech processing and audio-visual speech processing (enhancement, dereverberatin, separation, compressive coding). I'm very much into the concept of mixed reality. One example is our [Earable Computing](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/earables.html) aiming for acoustics augmented reality. 

I also work with Professor [Mark Hasegawa-Johnson](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~hasegawa/) if any project is related to speech.

## Hobbies:
* I'm an amateur of the classic GO game, with 4 Duan (in amateur levels). Also, I'm a big fan of the 299-GO-GROUP: who are [[Ying Zhan(ÊàòÈπ∞)2D]](https://space.bilibili.com/2051617240?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0), [[Jie Ke(ÊüØÊ¥Å)9D]](https://space.bilibili.com/525952604?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0), [[Xiao Lian(ËøûÁ¨ë)9D]](https://space.bilibili.com/526645204?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0).
* I'm an amateur of basketball, playing guard positions. Big fan of making sarcastic jokes and judgements about my favourite Lebron James and Kevin Durant üòè. Was fan of Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, and Stephen Curry.
* Big Movie Fan, my favourite directors are Kubrick, Ridley Scott, Villeneuve, Nolan, and the new star Damien Chazelle!
