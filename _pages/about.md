I'm a graduate researcher in UIUC [SyNRG](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/) working on machine learning and signal processing in general. My current research interest spans mostly about audio, visual, and motion sensing, and I feel quite excited to design modality fusion algorithms for real-world applications like [Earable Computing]([https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/earables.html) and AR/VR applications.

Before my graduate life, I did my undergrad in UIUC Computer Engineering from 2018-2021 exploring software/hardware system and AI.

Besides the study life, I'm interested in Game Go and Films.
