I'm a fifth-year ECE PhD candidate in UIUC [SiNRG](https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/) advised by Professor [Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/). I work on generative models (diffusion/flow matching) and microphone-array signal processing. I'll be graduating in May 2026 and will soon be looking for an industry research scientist role related to speech AI, spatial audio, or audio/music generative models. 
I also work with Professor [Mark Hasegawa-Johnson](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~hasegawa/) if any project is related to speech.
