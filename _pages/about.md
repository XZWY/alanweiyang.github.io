I'm a second-year graduate researcher in UIUC [SiNRG](https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/) advised by Professor [Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/). I'm working on machine learning and signal processing in general. My current research interest spans mostly about audio, visual, and motion sensing, and I feel quite excited to design modality fusion algorithms for real-world applications like [Earable Computing](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/earables.html) and AR/VR applications.

I also work with Professor [Mark Hasegawa-Johnson](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~hasegawa/) if any project involves a lot about human speech.

Before my graduate life, I did my undergrad in UIUC Computer Engineering from 2018-2021 exploring software/hardware system and AI.
